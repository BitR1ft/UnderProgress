"""
CWE Database Service (Day 58)

Provides an in-memory CWE lookup service populated from the MITRE CWE XML
database or a built-in minimal offline dataset (fallback).

The XML format used is the official MITRE CWE List XML:
    https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_latest.xml.zip

Usage::

    svc = CWEService()
    await svc.load()           # parse XML or use built-in fallback

    entry = svc.lookup("CWE-79")
    # CWEEntry(id="CWE-79", name="Improper Neutralization of Input …", ...)
