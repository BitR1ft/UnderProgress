# AutoPenTest AI — Year 1 Gap Coverage Plan
Professional, end-to-end plan to fully cover identified gaps, deliver production-grade capabilities, and meet/exceed Year 1 goals. No strict time constraints; sequence is designed for safe, incremental, testable progress.

## 0) Overview
This plan focuses on:
- Completing database persistence with PostgreSQL + Prisma (replacing in-memory stores).
- Integrating professional reconnaissance and vulnerability tooling (Naabu, Nuclei, Katana, GAU, Kiterunner, Wappalyzer, Shodan, Interactsh).
- Solidifying Neo4j graph schema, ingestion pipelines, and querying.
- Building MCP tool servers and AI agent with secure approval flows and streaming.
- Delivering a polished Next.js frontend with 180+ parameter forms and interactive 2D/3D graph visualization.
- Establishing observability, security hardening, and CI/CD required for a production system.
- Achieving and maintaining robust test coverage (80%+ unit/integration, E2E where applicable).

## 1) Goals & Success Criteria
- Replace all in-memory state with PostgreSQL via Prisma.
- Integrate external tools and unify outputs with robust orchestration, error handling, deduplication, and rate-limiting.
- Propagate all data to Neo4j with complete nodes/relationships and documented schema.
- Implement agent/mcp tool servers with strong safety controls (approval/stop/resume) and auditable operations.
- Frontend delivers full UX: auth, project CRUD, multi-step forms (180+ params), real-time progress (SSE/WS), and interactive 2D/3D graph.
- Observability: logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, alerts.
- Security posture: secrets, RBAC, audit logs, rate limits, dependency hygiene.
- CI/CD pipelines and release processes in place.
- Documentation comprehensive and up-to-date.
